My cat is a true polyglot. He speaks over 80 languages, including the weird language of letni!

To showcase his brilliance, I set up a website that allows you to interact with him. Come and check it out:

Be aware, he has a bit of an ego. He is very picky with whom he interacts with, and has a relatively short attention span. Be sure to say "hello" first and let him get accustomed to you!
