The poem refers to sharing a secret by breaking up the encryption key into smaller parts. Furthermore the name of the challenge is ssssecret. These two are references to the Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme. One can use tools like `ssss-combine`, or use PyCryptoDome to write a small python script to reverse it and get the flag.
