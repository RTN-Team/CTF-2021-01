I want to share a secret,
A secret dear to me.
But the secret to keeping a secret
Is to never give out the key.

So I broke it up in little pieces
As small as they can be.
Then after that you wouldn't expect
I handed them out for free.

Follow up these pieces
Understand them to a degree
At the very root of it all
The answer you will see
