Dear RTN,

As you might know, I am the CEO of False Fruits Ltd, and we are one of the main producers of smoothies in the country.

Recently, I received a message from our IT department that our security system has problems. Two of our employees did not follow the protocol to the letter, which resulted in the formula of our latest smoothie getting leaked to the public.

As one of our regulars, it is my duty to inform you about any possible security breaches in our systems. We are still investigating this incident, but since you are an expert in the field, any help is appreciated. 

Attached are some of the documents that resurfaced which you might find interesting.

Best regards,
Dr. E. Zecutive
CEO of False Fruits Ltd

P.S: The IT department said something about SHA 256 and public keys. Personally I have a hard time making heads and tails out of this nonsense.
